                Succulents hold a special place in our hearts not only because of their elegant beauty but also of their affordability and environmental friendliness. 
                They look similar to flowers especially rosette-types, but they live much longer and require much less care—the alternative sustainable choice for home decorations and gifts. 
                Succulents are known for their amazing ability to thrive in poor soils and low-water conditions. 
                Therefore, they symbolize endurance, harmony, and timelessness.

                They make it simple for anyone to help the environment by planting trees. 
                One Tree Planted works with awesome reforestation partners in North America, South America, Asia, and Africa who help get trees in the ground to restore forests after fires and floods, create jobs, build communities, and protect habitat for biodiversity.

                <strong>Smile Restaurant</strong> is a project of <a href="http://tuthientinhthuong.org/" target="_blank">Từ Thiện Tình Thương</a> (Kindness Philanthropy). 
                Smile Restaurant provides thousands of meals per days, selling at a much cheaper price (at least 1/10 of the food cost) to the less fortunate in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. 
                The food is always prepared fresh daily, and each meal is packed with nutritious ingredients that are delicious, filling, and heart warming. 
                No one is discriminated at Smile Restaurant, regardless of their jobs, backgrounds, appearances, or disabilities.
